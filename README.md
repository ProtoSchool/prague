# ProtoSchool Prague

Welcome to the Prague chapter of [ProtoSchool](https://proto.school)!

We are a group of people passionate about the decentralized web and excited to learn, teach, and share ideas. Everyone is welcome!

You can find all our events in meetup group [Decentralized Web Prague](https://www.meetup.com/dweb-prague/), where you should also RSVP if you plan to come. Some of the events might be limited on size (especially workshops) so RSVP is important!

If you are interested in something specific, or you would like to share something with us, don't hesitate and create issue and/or shoot us email to [dweb@uhlir.dev](dweb@uhlir.dev).

## Organizers

Our chapter is currently led by:
* Adam Uhlir ([@AuHau](https://github.com/AuHau))

### Wanna help?

We are always looking for people who want to help! If you are interested shoot some of the organizers email!
